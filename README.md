# The Role of SQL and NoSQL Databases in Data Engineering

Project developed at Digital Innovation One's Bootcamp Database Experience with expert guidance [Leonardo Cestarolli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lcestarolli/ "Leonardo Cestarolli").

When choosing a modern database, one of the biggest decisions is picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) data structure. While both are viable options, there are key differences between the two that users must keep in mind when making a decision.

- SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.

- SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

- SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

- SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
